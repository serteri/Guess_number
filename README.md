# Guess Number

I am trying to desing a guess number game.In the beginning computer choose a number between 1234 and 9876 because all numbers must be different. And you try to guess the number. For example computer chose 1234 and you guessed 1456 ,output would be +1 ,-1 because you did guess correct two number but one of them is in the correct position and the other is not.

At the end of the game , computer asks you for another game and saved your score.
